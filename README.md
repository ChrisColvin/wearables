#Wearable Device Analytics
##Purpose:
Internet of Things involves collecting data from devices such as cars, medical equipment and wearable devices.  The intent of the dataset will be to analyze the data generated from wearable devices namely, Samsung Galaxy S smartphones.

##Information
The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data and the transformation necessary to clean the data for analysis.
30 volunteers, aged 19-48, performed six activities while wearing a smartphone.  The accelerometer and gyroscope measured 3 axis for linear acceleration and 3 axis for angular velocity.
70% of the data was used for training and the remainder set was used for testing.
